# Replication-Higgs-Boson-to-4lepton
Replication of the Higgs boson to four leptons analysis using CERN Open Data and the ROOT Framework.
The project reconstructs key steps of the original CMS discovery, including histogram generation, candidate event selection, and data visualization.
Future plans: scaling full dataset analysis using cloud-based parallel processing.

Note: The project report and documentation are written in Serbian.
